All submissions from across the years.

## 2022 Language: Rust

Stepping out of the JS world and into the better, safer, and 🔥 blazingly faster 🔥 language, Rust.

### Getting started with Rust

```bash
# create a new cargo package for a new day.
# cargo new 2022/day-01-2022
cargo new <year>/<day-num>

# run the package
# cargo run day-01-2022
cargo run <day-num>

```

### 2021 Language: JS

Longest year streak so far at 45 stars.

This year I pushed to start every challenge at midnight. By the final week I found myself going later and later into the night, got too tired and made simple mistakes that took longer. Eventually switching to attempt during the day.

### 2015-2020

Always super excited to start it and got 3 days done, but life got in the way and I just forgot about it 🤷‍♂️
